Share2Care is a platform that connects individuals who are eager to make a positive difference in their communities. By sharing not only excess food but also clothes, stationary, and more, Share2Care aims to create a sustainable future. It serves as a bridge between resource providers and those in need, facilitating the efficient distribution of items.

 In addition, Share2Care can facilate partnerships with NGOs, further amplifying its impact and potential for making a difference.

To participate in Share2Care, users can drop a pin on the interactive map provided, specifying essential details such as the quantity, type of item, and any additional relevant information. This information is then made readily available to other users who are eager to distribute these resources to those in need.
